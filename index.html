          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJhin is the single most busted champion ever introduced to the game league of legends(created in 1987)
            since the introduction of Hulk Hogan as a champion. With a creative FOUR hit passive,
            that's right FOUR not three like those other garbage champions. Jhin will one shot anyone in
            the entire game with his fourth shot from at least 127 meters(142 with RFC). Then after firing
            his fourth shot, he gains movement speed upwards of Mach III allowing him to run after the rest
            of your garbage team comp.</p>

          <p class="miniheader">Four . . .</p>
          <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJhin has a massive fourth shot. With rfc, IE, stormrazor, and swifties alone, he will absolutely obliterate you.
            Jhin begins toying with his target by tickling them with three normal autos to whittle them down  abit., then he
            proceeds to absolutely just explode all over them with his massive fourth shot. Just obliterates the
            champion. Jhin's obsession with four is what drives him, he does everything in pairs of four, 4 socks,
            4 infinity edges, 4 shoes, team liquid, 4 hands, 4 eyes, and 4 shots.</p>
